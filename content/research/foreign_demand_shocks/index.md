abstract: 'Introducing heterogeneous households into a New Keynesian model of a
          small open economy enables the model to fit a set of stylized empirical facts
          about the transmission of foreign demand shocks. In the absence of a strong
          labor income effect on consumption, the model counterfactually implies that
          domestic consumption decreases as the central bank raises the interest rate to
          curb domestic inflation. With plausible marginal propensities to consume, the
          model instead produces the observed increase in domestic consumption of both
          tradeable and non-tradeable goods. This implies that foreign demand shocks are
          more important for international business-cycle comovement than predicted by
          existing models. Our findings also have implications for stabilization policies:
          While monetary policy is well-suited to counteract foreign demand shocks, tra-
          ditional fiscal policies are inadequate, as they do not provide sufficient stimulus
          to the tradeable sector. This poses a particular challenge for countries with a
          fixed exchange rate or in a monetary union.'
