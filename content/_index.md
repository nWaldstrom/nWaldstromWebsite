          Introducing heterogeneous households into a New Keynesian model of a
          small open economy enables the model to fit a set of stylized empirical facts
          about the transmission of foreign demand shocks. In the absence of a strong
          labor income effect on consumption, the model counterfactually implies that
          domestic consumption decreases as the central bank raises the interest rate to
          curb domestic inflation. With plausible marginal propensities to consume, the
          model instead produces the observed increase in domestic consumption of both
          tradeable and non-tradeable goods. This implies that foreign demand shocks are
          more important for international business-cycle comovement than predicted by
          existing models. Our findings also have implications for stabilization policies:
          While monetary policy is well-suited to counteract foreign demand shocks, tra-
          ditional fiscal policies are inadequate, as they do not provide sufficient stimulus
          to the tradeable sector. This poses a particular challenge for countries with a
          fixed exchange rate or in a monetary union.

          We investigate the role of firm heterogeneity and adjustment costs in the trans-
          mission of foreign supply shocks. Our starting point comes from a theoretical
          insight: If larger firms rely more on easily adjustable inputs, such as materials,
          then the aggregate output response to changes in the price of these inputs gets
          amplified relative to a representative firm economy. We next provide empirical ev-
          idence that larger firms are indeed more materials-intensive and more responsive
          to an exogenous foreign shock. We show that a New-Keynesian general equilib-
          rium model with multiple sectors and firm heterogeneity is consistent with these
          facts. We find that firm heterogeneity, in line with the data, amplifies the response
          of output and prices to a foreign supply shock, but dampens the labor and GDP
          responses.

          Work in progress. <br>
          {{< spoiler text="Abstract" >}}
          What is the effect of inflation on aggregate demand? In the canonical New Keynesian model the entire transmission occurs through the monetary policy response. I show that a heterogeneous agent models featuring positive MPCs and sticky wages features an additional transmission channel whereby inflation suppress real wages and aggregate demand to the extent that the MPC out of labor income is greater than the MPC out of profits, hence highlighting the distributional role of inflation. Indexing nominal wage growth to inflation is an adept policy in terms of stabilizing aggregate demand in the face of inflationary shocks. 
              The theory also predicts larger welfare losses from inflation than the representative agent counterpart, and help rationalize a strong monetary policy tightening in the face of large surges in inflation.
