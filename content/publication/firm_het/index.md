abstract: 'We investigate the role of firm heterogeneity and adjustment costs in the trans-
          mission of foreign supply shocks. Our starting point comes from a theoretical
          insight: If larger firms rely more on easily adjustable inputs, such as materials,
          then the aggregate output response to changes in the price of these inputs gets
          amplified relative to a representative firm economy. We next provide empirical ev-
          idence that larger firms are indeed more materials-intensive and more responsive
          to an exogenous foreign shock. We show that a New-Keynesian general equilib-
          rium model with multiple sectors and firm heterogeneity is consistent with these
          facts. We find that firm heterogeneity, in line with the data, amplifies the response
          of output and prices to a foreign supply shock, but dampens the labor and GDP
          responses.'
