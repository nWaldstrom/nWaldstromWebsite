          We investigate the role of firm heterogeneity and adjustment costs in the trans-
          mission of foreign supply shocks. Our starting point comes from a theoretical
          insight: If larger firms rely more on easily adjustable inputs, such as materials,
          then the aggregate output response to changes in the price of these inputs gets
          amplified relative to a representative firm economy. We next provide empirical ev-
          idence that larger firms are indeed more materials-intensive and more responsive
          to an exogenous foreign shock. We show that a New-Keynesian general equilib-
          rium model with multiple sectors and firm heterogeneity is consistent with these
          facts. We find that firm heterogeneity, in line with the data, amplifies the response
          of output and prices to a foreign supply shock, but dampens the labor and GDP
          responses.

#           Introducing heterogeneous households into a New Keynesian model of a
#           small open economy enables the model to fit a set of stylized empirical facts
#           about the transmission of foreign demand shocks. In the absence of a strong
#           labor income effect on consumption, the model counterfactually implies that
#           domestic consumption decreases as the central bank raises the interest rate to
#           curb domestic inflation. With plausible marginal propensities to consume, the
#           model instead produces the observed increase in domestic consumption of both
#           tradeable and non-tradeable goods. This implies that foreign demand shocks are
#           more important for international business-cycle comovement than predicted by
#           existing models. Our findings also have implications for stabilization policies:
#           While monetary policy is well-suited to counteract foreign demand shocks, tra-
#           ditional fiscal policies are inadequate, as they do not provide sufficient stimulus
#           to the tradeable sector. This poses a particular challenge for countries with a
#           fixed exchange rate or in a monetary union.
